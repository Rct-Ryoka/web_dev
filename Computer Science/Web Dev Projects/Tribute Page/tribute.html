        <div id="tribute-info">
            <p>Vaynerchuk was born on 14th November 1975 in Babruysk, U.S.S.R and moved to New Jersey, United States in 1978.
                He attended Mount Ida College and after graduation started transforming his father’s liquor store into something much bigger.
                He renamed the store ‘Wine Library’ and started video blogging through his ‘Wine Library TV’ which is a broadcast on everything about wine.
                Vaynerchuk boosted the sales of the Wine Library from 4 million dollars to 60 million. He is a wine enthusiast which helped him become immensely successful in his business.
                Gary Vaynerchuk’s latest venture is ‘VaynerMedia’.</p>
    
            <p>It was a perfect (and perfectly predictable) joke at his own expense. 
                Vaynerchuk has created two successful companies; he is a bestselling author;
                he can command six-figure fees for speaking engagements; and he has 1.1 million Twitter followers.
                But he is largely unknown to the American television-viewing public. Rather, he is Internet famous.
                That fame happened by design and by years of meticulous planning—and it has drawn vocal critics for a style that is loud, bombastic and blatantly self-promotional.
                 (A sample exhortation from a video commanding people to subscribe to his YouTube channel:
                  “Fucking follow me, right now.”)
            </p>
            <p>A common line of criticism against Vaynerchuk is that he is a snake-oil salesman, one of a growing number of Internet celebrity marketers who make their money telling eager beaver entrepreneurs that they, too, can get rich and famous by self-marketing on social media.
                   “People think I’m a hack, simply because a lot of people that were early to social media really were hacks,” he told Fortune, sitting in the casino at the Borgata Atlantic City on the second night of pageant preliminaries in September.
                    “And I get lumped in with them. But when someone says to me, ‘You’ve only achieved this because you’re big on social media,’ I say, ‘want to see my calendar?’”
